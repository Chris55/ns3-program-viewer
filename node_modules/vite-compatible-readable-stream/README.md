# vite-compatible-readable-stream

This is a fork of [readable-stream](https://www.npmjs.org/package/readable-stream), but with the circular dependencies refactored so that it works in Rollup, and therefore Vite production builds.

Expected to be used with [vite-plugin-shim-react-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-shim-react-pdf).
