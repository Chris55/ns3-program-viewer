# @react-pdf/render

> React-pdf render engine

## How to install

```sh
yarn add @react-pdf/render
```

## How it works

```js
const render = require('@react-pdf/render');
const primitives = require('@react-pdf/primitives');

const view = {
  type: primitives.View,
  style: {
    backgroundColor: 'red',
    borderTopLeftRadius: 5,
    borderTopRightRadius: 10,
    borderBottomLeftRadius: 0,
    borderBottomRightRadius: 15,
    borderTopColor: 'yellow',
    borderLeftColor: 'green',
    borderBottomColor: 'black',
    borderRightColor: 'purple',
  },
  box: {
    left: 20,
    top: 20,
    width: 100,
    height: 80,
    borderTopWidth: 3,
    borderLeftWidth: 2,
    borderBottomWidth: 1,
    borderRightWidth: 4,
  },
};

const doc = {
  type: primitives.Document,
  children: [
    {
      type: primitives.Page,
      box: { width: 400, height: 600 },
      children: [view],
    },
  ],
};

// Provide your own context
const ctx = createContext();

render.default(ctx, doc);
```

This library exports a `render` function that takes two arguments:

- _ctx_: This is the target context where the document is going to be rendered. React-pdf currently uses a [pdfkit](https://github.com/react-pdf/pdfkit) document as context, but it can target any other type of structure as long as it signature matches pdfkit API. In the future this will enable rendering documents into muliple formats in addition to PDF.
- _node_: Document root node. A node is a nested structure that defines a single element in a document. They are defined by it's `type` and arguments.

## Node structure

A node represents a single element inside a document. It's mainly defined by it's `type` (mandatory) field in addition to other values to define where that element is positioned inside the document (`box`), how it looks (`style`), how it should behave (`params`) and what sub-nodes it contains (`children`).

The root node must always be of type `DOCUMENT`, containing as many `PAGE` nodes as desired inside it's children field.

Bare in mind this package does not handle any type of node positioning, inheritance, style transformations or any other layout related logic. It's role is limited to render exactly the node it get's into the provided context. Take this into account when definig styles as `paddingTop`, `paddingLeft` and so on instead of the shortcut `padding`. For layout or styles transformation this project provides separate packages.

### node.type

Mandatory field specifiying the type of the particular node. The full list of types can be found and imported from `@react-pdf/primitives`

### node.box

Defines bounding box where a particular node is located inside a document

- left
- top
- width
- height
- paddingTop
- paddingLeft
- paddingBottom
- paddingRight
- marginTop
- marginLeft
- marginBottom
- marginRight
- borderTopWidth
- borderLeftWidth
- borderBottomWidth
- borderRightWidth

### node.style

Defines how the node looks like. There are some types of nodes that expect special style values, but generally all support:

- color
- opacity
- overflow
- backgroundColor
- borderTopLeftRadius
- borderTopRightRadius
- borderBottomLeftRadius
- borderBottomRightRadius
- borderTopColor
- borderLeftColor
- borderBottomColor
- borderRightColor
- _others..._

### node.props

Specific node params needed to render correctly ot behave like certain way. Specially needed for SVG nodes

## PDF example

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const render = require('@react-pdf/render');
const pdfkit = require('@react-pdf/pdfkit');

const PDFDocument = pdfkit.default;

const ctx = new PDFDocument({ autoFirstPage: false });

const doc = {}; // See above

render.default(ctx, doc);

const stream = fs.createWriteStream('./test.pdf');

ctx.pipe(stream);
```

## How to install

```sh
yarn add @react-pdf/renderer
```

## How it works

```jsx
import { Document, Page, Text, View, StyleSheet } from '@react-pdf/renderer';

// Create styles
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  page: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    backgroundColor: '#E4E4E4',
  },
  section: {
    margin: 10,
    padding: 10,
    flexGrow: 1,
  },
});

// Create Document Component
const MyDocument = () => (
  <Document>
    <Page size="A4" style={styles.page}>
      <View style={styles.section}>
        <Text>Section #1</Text>
      </View>
      <View style={styles.section}>
        <Text>Section #2</Text>
      </View>
    </Page>
  </Document>
);
```

### `Web.` Render in DOM

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { PDFViewer } from '@react-pdf/renderer';

const App = () => (
  <PDFViewer>
    <MyDocument />
  </PDFViewer>
);

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### `Node.` Save in a file

```jsx
import ReactPDF from '@react-pdf/renderer';

ReactPDF.render(<MyDocument />, `${__dirname}/example.pdf`);
```

## Examples

For each example, try opening `output.pdf` to see the result.

# @react-pdf/stylesheet

> React-pdf styles engine

## How to install

```sh
yarn add @react-pdf/stylesheet
```

## How it works

```js
const stylesheet = require('@react-pdf/stylesheet');

const container = {
  width: 400,
  height: 600,
  orientation: 'portrait',
};

const style = {
  margin: 20,
  width: '50vw',
  height: '20vh',
  borderRadius: 5,
  fontWeight: 'semibold',
  borderBottom: '2 solid yellow',
  '@media max-width: 500': {
    backgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 0, 0)',
  },
};

const computed = stylesheet(container, style);

// Computed
// {
//   width: 200,
//   height: 120,
//   marginTop: 20,
//   marginLeft: 20,
//   marginRight: 20,
//   marginBottom: 20,
//   marginBottom: 20,
//   borderTopLeftRadius: 5,
//   borderTopRightRadius: 5,
//   borderBottomLeftRadius: 5,
//   borderBottomRightRadius: 5,
//   fontWeight: 600,
//   borderBottomWidth: 2,
//   borderBottomStyle: 'solid',
//   borderBottomColor: 'yellow',
//   backgroundColor: '#FF0000'
// }
```

This library exports a `stylesheet` function that takes two arguments:

- _container_: Container where the styles are being computed into. It specifies the `width` and `height` in points (needed for media queries and unit conversions), and optionally the container `orientation` (needed for certain media queries).
- _style_: Style to be computed. JS object with raw styles that you would like to get in a normalized format.

# @react-pdf/textkit

## Acknowledges

This project is a fork of [textkit](https://github.com/foliojs/textkit) by @devongovett and continued under the scope of this project since it has react-pdf specific features. Any recongnition should go to him and the original project mantainers.

## Layout process

1. split into paragraphs
2. get bidi runs and paragraph direction
3. font substitution - map to resolved font runs
4. script itemization
5. font shaping - text to glyphs
6. line breaking
7. bidi reordering
8. justification
9. get a list of rectangles by intersecting path, line, and exclusion paths
10. perform line breaking to get acceptable break points for each fragment
11. ellipsize line if necessary
12. bidi reordering
13. justification

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - binary@0.3.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

binary
======

Unpack multibyte binary values from buffers and streams.
You can specify the endianness and signedness of the fields to be unpacked too.

This module is a cleaner and more complete version of
[bufferlist](https://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist)'s binary module that
runs on pre-allocated buffers instead of a linked list.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary)

examples
========

stream.js
---------

``` js
var binary = require('binary');

var ws = binary()
    .word32lu('x')
    .word16bs('y')
    .word16bu('z')
    .tap(function (vars) {
        console.dir(vars);
    })
;
process.stdin.pipe(ws);
process.stdin.resume();
```

output:

```
$ node examples/stream.js
abcdefgh
{ x: 1684234849, y: 25958, z: 26472 }
^D
```

parse.js
--------

``` js
var buf = new Buffer([ 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 0 ]);

var binary = require('binary');
var vars = binary.parse(buf)
    .word16ls('ab')
    .word32bu('cf')
    .word8('x')
    .vars
;
console.dir(vars);
```

output:

```
{ ab: 25185, cf: 1667523942, x: 0 }
```

methods
=======

`var binary = require('binary')`

var b = binary()
----------------

Return a new writable stream `b` that has the chainable methods documented below
for buffering binary input.

binary.parse(buf)
-----------------

Parse a static buffer in one pass. Returns a chainable interface with the
methods below plus a `vars` field to get at the variable stash as the last item
in a chain.

In parse mode, methods will set their keys to `null` if the buffer isn't big
enough except `buffer()` and `scan()` which read up up to the end of the buffer
and stop.

b.word{8,16,32,64}{l,b}{e,u,s}(key)
-----------------------------------

Parse bytes in the buffer or stream given:

* number of bits
* endianness ( l : little, b : big ),
* signedness ( u and e : unsigned, s : signed )

These functions won't start parsing until all previous parser functions have run
and the data is available.

The result of the parse goes into the variable stash at `key`.
If `key` has dots (`.`s), it refers to a nested address. If parent container
values don't exist they will be created automatically, so for instance you can
assign into `dst.addr` and `dst.port` and the `dst` key in the variable stash
will be `{ addr : x, port : y }` afterwards.

b.buffer(key, size)
-------------------

Take `size` bytes directly off the buffer stream, putting the resulting buffer
slice in the variable stash at `key`. If `size` is a string, use the value at
`vars[size]`. The key follows the same dotted address rules as the word
functions.

b.scan(key, buffer)
-------------------

Search for `buffer` in the stream and store all the intervening data in the
stash at at `key`, excluding the search buffer. If `buffer` passed as a string,
it will be converted into a Buffer internally.

For example, to read in a line you can just do:

``` js
var b = binary()
    .scan('line', new Buffer('\r\n'))
    .tap(function (vars) {
        console.log(vars.line)
    })
;
stream.pipe(b);
```

b.tap(cb)
---------

The callback `cb` is provided with the variable stash from all the previous
actions once they've all finished.

You can nest additional actions onto `this` inside the callback.

b.into(key, cb)
---------------

Like `.tap()`, except all nested actions will assign into a `key` in the `vars`
stash.

b.loop(cb)
----------

Loop, each time calling `cb(end, vars)` for function `end` and the variable
stash with `this` set to a new chain for nested parsing. The loop terminates
once `end` is called.

b.flush()
---------

Clear the variable stash entirely.

installation
============

To install with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):

```
npm install binary
```

notes
=====

The word64 functions will only return approximations since javascript uses ieee
floating point for all number types. Mind the loss of precision.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - brotli@1.3.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Brotli.js

Brotli.js is port of the [Brotli](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-alakuijala-brotli-01) compression algorithm (as used in the [WOFF2](http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/) font format) to JavaScript. The decompressor is hand ported, and the compressor is ported
with Emscripten.  The original C++ source code can be found [here](http://github.com/google/brotli).

## Installation and usage

Install using npm.

    npm install brotli

If you want to use brotli in the browser, you should use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to build it.

In node, or in browserify, you can load brotli in the standard way:

```javascript
var brotli = require('brotli');
```

You can also require just the `decompress` function or just the `compress` function, which is useful for browserify builds.
For example, here's how you'd require just the `decompress` function.

```javascript
var decompress = require('brotli/decompress');
```

## API

### brotli.decompress(buffer, [outSize])

Decompresses the given buffer to produce the original input to the compressor.
The `outSize` parameter is optional, and will be computed by the decompressor
if not provided. Inside a WOFF2 file, this can be computed from the WOFF2 directory.

```javascript
// decode a buffer where the output size is known
brotli.decompress(compressedData, uncompressedLength);

// decode a buffer where the output size is not known
brotli.decompress(fs.readFileSync('compressed.bin'));
```

### brotli.compress(buffer, isText = false)

Compresses the given buffer. Pass optional parameters as the second argument.

```javascript
// encode a buffer of binary data
brotli.compress(fs.readFileSync('myfile.bin'));

// encode some data with options (default options shown)
brotli.compress(fs.readFileSync('myfile.bin'), {
  mode: 0, // 0 = generic, 1 = text, 2 = font (WOFF2)
  quality: 11, // 0 - 11
  lgwin: 22 // window size
});
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - buffers@0.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

buffers
=======

Treat a collection of Buffers as a single contiguous partially mutable Buffer.

Where possible, operations execute without creating a new Buffer and copying
everything over.

This is a cleaner more Buffery rehash of
[bufferlist](http://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist).

example
=======

slice
-----

    var Buffers = require('buffers');
    var bufs = Buffers();
    bufs.push(new Buffer([1,2,3]));
    bufs.push(new Buffer([4,5,6,7]));
    bufs.push(new Buffer([8,9,10]));
    
    console.dir(bufs.slice(2,8))

output:

    $ node examples/slice.js 
    <Buffer 03 04 05 06 07 08>

splice
------

    var Buffers = require('buffers');
    var bufs = Buffers([
        new Buffer([1,2,3]),
        new Buffer([4,5,6,7]),
        new Buffer([8,9,10]),
    ]);
    
    var removed = bufs.splice(2, 4);
    console.dir({
        removed : removed.slice(),
        bufs : bufs.slice(),
    });
    
output:

    $ node examples/splice.js
    { removed: <Buffer 03 04 05 06>,
      bufs: <Buffer 01 02 07 08 09 0a> }

methods
=======

Buffers(buffers)
----------------

Create a Buffers with an array of `Buffer`s if specified, else `[]`.

.push(buf1, buf2...)
--------------------

Push buffers onto the end. Just like `Array.prototype.push`.

.unshift(buf1, buf2...)
-----------------------

Unshift buffers onto the head. Just like `Array.prototype.unshift`.

.slice(i, j)
------------

Slice a range out of the buffer collection as if it were contiguous.
Works just like the `Array.prototype.slice` version.

.splice(i, howMany, replacements)
---------------------------------

Splice the buffer collection as if it were contiguous.
Works just like `Array.prototype.splice`, even the replacement part!

.copy(dst, dstStart, start, end)
--------------------------------

Copy the buffer collection as if it were contiguous to the `dst` Buffer with the
specified bounds.
Works just like `Buffer.prototype.copy`.

.get(i)
-------

Get a single element at index `i`.

.set(i, x)
----------

Set a single element's value at index `i`.

.indexOf(needle, offset)
----------

Find a string or buffer `needle` inside the buffer collection. Returns
the position of the search string or -1 if the search string was not
found.

Provide an `offset` to skip that number of characters at the beginning
of the search. This can be used to find additional matches.

This function will return the correct result even if the search string
is spread out over multiple internal buffers.

.toBuffer()
-----------

Convert the buffer collection to a single buffer, equivalent with `.slice(0, buffers.length)`;

.toString(encoding, start, end)
-----------

Decodes and returns a string from the buffer collection.
Works just like `Buffer.prototype.toString`

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - chainsaw@0.1.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

Chainsaw
========

Build chainable fluent interfaces the easy way in node.js.

With this meta-module you can write modules with chainable interfaces.
Chainsaw takes care of all of the boring details and makes nested flow control
super simple too.

Just call `Chainsaw` with a constructor function like in the examples below.
In your methods, just do `saw.next()` to move along to the next event and
`saw.nest()` to create a nested chain.

Examples
========

add_do.js
---------

This silly example adds values with a chainsaw.

    var Chainsaw = require('chainsaw');
    
    function AddDo (sum) {
        return Chainsaw(function (saw) {
            this.add = function (n) {
                sum += n;
                saw.next();
            };
             
            this.do = function (cb) {
                saw.nest(cb, sum);
            };
        });
    }
    
    AddDo(0)
        .add(5)
        .add(10)
        .do(function (sum) {
            if (sum > 12) this.add(-10);
        })
        .do(function (sum) {
            console.log('Sum: ' + sum);
        })
    ;

Output:
    Sum: 5

prompt.js
---------

This example provides a wrapper on top of stdin with the help of
[node-lazy](https://github.com/pkrumins/node-lazy) for line-processing.

    var Chainsaw = require('chainsaw');
    var Lazy = require('lazy');
    
    module.exports = Prompt;
    function Prompt (stream) {
        var waiting = [];
        var lines = [];
        var lazy = Lazy(stream).lines.map(String)
            .forEach(function (line) {
                if (waiting.length) {
                    var w = waiting.shift();
                    w(line);
                }
                else lines.push(line);
            })
        ;
        
        var vars = {};
        return Chainsaw(function (saw) {
            this.getline = function (f) {
                var g = function (line) {
                    saw.nest(f, line, vars);
                };
                
                if (lines.length) g(lines.shift());
                else waiting.push(g);
            };
            
            this.do = function (cb) {
                saw.nest(cb, vars);
            };
        });
    }

And now for the new Prompt() module in action:

    var util = require('util');
    var stdin = process.openStdin();
     
    Prompt(stdin)
        .do(function () {
            util.print('x = ');
        })
        .getline(function (line, vars) {
            vars.x = parseInt(line, 10);
        })
        .do(function () {
            util.print('y = ');
        })
        .getline(function (line, vars) {
            vars.y = parseInt(line, 10);
        })
        .do(function (vars) {
            if (vars.x + vars.y < 10) {
                util.print('z = ');
                this.getline(function (line) {
                    vars.z = parseInt(line, 10);
                })
            }
            else {
                vars.z = 0;
            }
        })
        .do(function (vars) {
            console.log('x + y + z = ' + (vars.x + vars.y + vars.z));
            process.exit();
        })
    ;

Installation
============

With [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), just do:
    npm install chainsaw

or clone this project on github:

    git clone http://github.com/substack/node-chainsaw.git

To run the tests with [expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso),
just do:

    expresso


Light Mode vs Full Mode
=======================

`node-chainsaw` supports two different modes. In full mode, every
action is recorded, which allows you to replay actions using the
`jump()`, `trap()` and `down()` methods.

However, if your chainsaws are long-lived, recording every action can
consume a tremendous amount of memory, so we also offer a "light" mode
where actions are not recorded and the aforementioned methods are
disabled.

To enable light mode simply use `Chainsaw.light()` to construct your
saw, instead of `Chainsaw()`.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - dfa@1.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# dfa

Compiles a regular expression like syntax to fast deterministic finite automata.
Useful for pattern matching against non-string sequences.

## Example

This example matches [Hangul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul) syllables. The symbols defined in the machine are Unicode character categories which could be mapped from code points.

Machine definition:

```coffeescript
# define symbols
X   = 0; # Other character
L   = 1; # Leading consonant
V   = 2; # Medial vowel
T   = 3; # Trailing consonant
LV  = 4; # Composed <LV> syllable
LVT = 5; # Composed <LVT> syllable
M   = 6; # Tone mark

# define variables
decomposed = L V T?;
partial = LV T?;
composed = LVT;

# define main state machine pattern
main = (decomposed | partial | composed) M?;
```

Visualized, the machine looks like this (double circles are accepting states):

![dfa](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19409/19143719/8fbc6a12-8b5a-11e6-868d-99621644d094.png)

Compiling and using the machine:

```javascript
import compile from 'dfa/compile';
import fs from 'fs';

let stateMachine = compile(fs.readFileSync('hangul.machine', 'utf8'));

// find matches
for (let [startIndex, endIndex] of stateMachine.match([0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 6]) {
  console.log('match:', startIndex, endIndex);
}
```

Output:
```
match: 1 3
match: 5 6
```

## Syntax

A state machine file contains a list of assignment statements. Comments are also allowed
and are started with the `#` character. Each statement is an assignment of a variable name
to a value or expression. Assigning a variable to a number produces a symbol, which is
added to the state machine's alphabet. Assigning a variable to an expression allows
for substitutions into later expressions. The special `main` variable should always be
assigned to at the end of the file, and is the final expression that will be compiled.

A subset of common regular expression syntax is supported. A list of operators and their
precedence is below. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated left to right.

| Precedence | Syntax     | Type          | Meaning                                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------| ------------------------------------------ |
| 1          | `a \| b`   | Alternation   | Matches either `a` or `b`                  |
| 2          | `a b`      | Concatenation | Matches `a` followed by `b`                |
| 3          | `a*`       | Repetition    | Matches zero or more occurrences of `a`    |
| 3          | `a+`       | Repetition    | Matches one ore more occurrences of `a`    |
| 3          | `a?`       | Optional      | Matches zero or one occurrence of `a`      |
| 3          | `a{n}`     | Repetition    | Matches exactly n occurrences of `a`       |
| 3          | `a{n,}`    | Repetition    | Matches n or more occurrences of `a`       |
| 3          | `a{,n}`    | Repetition    | Matches up to n occurrences of `a`         |
| 3          | `a{n,m}`   | Repetition    | Matches n to m occurrences of `a`          |
| 4          | `t:<expr>` | Tag           | Tags the following expression with tag `t` |
| 5          | `(<expr>)` | Grouping      | Groups an expression                       |

      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1. Grants

     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license:

     a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
        modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
        Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as
        part of a Larger Work; and

     b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
        sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
        or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
     such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
        Version); or

     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
        Contributions.

     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the
     notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
     under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
     Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form
     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how
     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or
     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,
        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for
        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered
     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at
     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of
     either this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent
     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the
   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
   understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,
     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.
     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an
     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of
     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and
     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License
     shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this
   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License
   except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
   this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

      This Source Code Form is subject to the
      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not
      distributed with this file, You can
      obtain one at
      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

      This Source Code Form is “Incompatible
      With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by
      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - filelist@1.0.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## FileList

A FileList is a lazy-evaluated list of files. When given a list
of glob patterns for possible files to be included in the file
list, instead of searching the file structures to find the files,
a FileList holds the pattern for latter use.

This allows you to define a FileList to match any number of
files, but only search out the actual files when then FileList
itself is actually used. The key is that the first time an
element of the FileList/Array is requested, the pending patterns
are resolved into a real list of file names.

### Usage

Add files to the list with the `include` method. You can add glob
patterns, individual files, or RegExp objects. When the Array
methods are invoked on the FileList, these items are resolved to
an actual list of files.

```javascript
var fl = new FileList();
fl.include('test/*.js');
fl.exclude('test/helpers.js');
```

Use the `exclude` method to override inclusions. You can use this
when your inclusions are too broad.

### Array methods

FileList has lazy-evaluated versions of most of the array
methods, including the following:

* join
* pop
* push
* concat
* reverse
* shift
* unshift
* slice
* splice
* sort
* filter
* forEach
* some
* every
* map
* indexOf
* lastIndexOf
* reduce
* reduceRight

When you call one of these methods, the items in the FileList
will be resolved to the full list of files, and the method will
be invoked on that result.

### Special `length` method

`length`: FileList includes a length *method* (instead of a
property) which returns the number of actual files in the list
once it's been resolved.

### FileList-specific methods

`include`: Add a filename/glob/regex to the list

`exclude`: Override inclusions by excluding a filename/glob/regex

`resolve`: Resolve the items in the FileList to the full list of
files. This method is invoked automatically when one of the array
methods is called.

`toArray`: Immediately resolves the list of items, and returns an
actual array of filepaths.

`clearInclusions`: Clears any pending items -- must be used
before resolving the list.

`clearExclusions`: Clears the list of exclusions rules.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - fontkit@2.0.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# fontkit

Fontkit is an advanced font engine for Node and the browser, used by [PDFKit](https://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit). It supports many font formats, advanced glyph substitution and layout features, glyph path extraction, color emoji glyphs, font subsetting, and more.

## Features

* Supports TrueType (.ttf), OpenType (.otf), WOFF, WOFF2, TrueType Collection (.ttc), and Datafork TrueType (.dfont) font files
* Supports mapping characters to glyphs, including support for ligatures and other advanced substitutions (see below)
* Supports reading glyph metrics and laying out glyphs, including support for kerning and other advanced layout features (see below)
* Advanced OpenType features including glyph substitution (GSUB) and positioning (GPOS)
* Apple Advanced Typography (AAT) glyph substitution features (morx table)
* Support for getting glyph vector paths and converting them to SVG paths, or rendering them to a graphics context
* Supports TrueType (glyf) and PostScript (CFF) outlines
* Support for color glyphs (e.g. emoji), including Apple’s SBIX table, and Microsoft’s COLR table
* Support for AAT variation glyphs, allowing for nearly infinite design control over weight, width, and other axes.
* Font subsetting support - create a new font including only the specified glyphs

## Installation

    npm install fontkit

## Example

```javascript
var fontkit = require('fontkit');

// open a font synchronously
var font = fontkit.openSync('font.ttf');

// layout a string, using default shaping features.
// returns a GlyphRun, describing glyphs and positions.
var run = font.layout('hello world!');

// get an SVG path for a glyph
var svg = run.glyphs[0].path.toSVG();

// create a font subset
var subset = font.createSubset();
run.glyphs.forEach(function(glyph) {
  subset.includeGlyph(glyph);
});

let buffer = subset.encode();
```

## API

### `fontkit.open(filename, postscriptName = null)`

Opens a font file asynchronously, and returns a `Promise` with a font object. For collection fonts (such as TrueType collection files), you can pass a `postscriptName` to get that font out of the collection instead of a collection object.

### `fontkit.openSync(filename, postscriptName = null)`

Opens a font file synchronously, and returns a font object. For collection fonts (such as TrueType collection files), you can pass a `postscriptName` to get that font out of the collection instead of a collection object.

### `fontkit.create(buffer, postscriptName = null)`

Returns a font object for the given buffer. For collection fonts (such as TrueType collection files), you can pass a `postscriptName` to get that font out of the collection instead of a collection object.

## Font objects

There are several different types of font objects that are returned by fontkit depending on the font format. They all inherit from the `TTFFont` class and have the same public API, described below.

### Metadata properties

The following properties are strings (or null if the font does not contain strings for them) describing the font, as specified by the font creator.

* `postscriptName`
* `fullName`
* `familyName`
* `subfamilyName`
* `copyright`
* `version`

### Metrics

The following properties describe the general metrics of the font. See [here](http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-3.html) for a good overview of how all of these properties relate to one another.

* `unitsPerEm` - the size of the font’s internal coordinate grid
* `ascent` - the font’s [ascender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography))
* `descent` - the font’s [descender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descender)
* `lineGap` - the amount of space that should be included between lines
* `underlinePosition` - the offset from the normal underline position that should be used
* `underlineThickness` - the weight of the underline that should be used
* `italicAngle` - if this is an italic font, the angle the cursor should be drawn at to match the font design
* `capHeight` - the height of capital letters above the baseline. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_height) for more details.
* `xHeight`- the height of lower case letters. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height) for more details.
* `bbox` - the font’s bounding box, i.e. the box that encloses all glyphs in the font

### Other properties

* `numGlyphs` - the number of glyphs in the font
* `characterSet` - an array of all of the unicode code points supported by the font
* `availableFeatures` - an array of all [OpenType feature tags](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featuretags.htm) (or mapped AAT tags) supported by the font (see below for a description of this)

### Character to glyph mapping

Fontkit includes several methods for character to glyph mapping, including support for advanced OpenType and AAT substitutions.

#### `font.glyphForCodePoint(codePoint)`

Maps a single unicode code point (number) to a Glyph object. Does not perform any advanced substitutions (there is no context to do so).

#### `font.hasGlyphForCodePoint(codePoint)`

Returns whether there is glyph in the font for the given unicode code point.

#### `font.glyphsForString(string)`

This method returns an array of Glyph objects for the given string. This is only a one-to-one mapping from characters
to glyphs. For most uses, you should use `font.layout` (described below), which provides a much more advanced mapping
supporting AAT and OpenType shaping.

### Glyph metrics and layout

Fontkit includes several methods for accessing glyph metrics and performing layout, including support for kerning and other advanced OpenType positioning adjustments.

#### `font.widthOfGlyph(glyph_id)`

Returns the advance width (described above) for a single glyph id.

#### `font.layout(string, features = [] | {})`

This method returns a `GlyphRun` object, which includes an array of `Glyph`s and `GlyphPosition`s for the given string.
`Glyph` objects are described below. `GlyphPosition` objects include 4 properties: `xAdvance`, `yAdvance`, `xOffset`,
and `yOffset`.

The `features` parameter is either an array of [OpenType feature tags](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/featuretags.htm) to be applied
in addition to the default set, or an object mapping OpenType features to a boolean enabling or disabling each. If this is an AAT font, the OpenType feature tags are mapped to AAT features.

### Variation fonts

Fontkit has support for AAT variation fonts, where glyphs can adjust their shape according to user defined settings along
various axes including weight, width, and slant. Font designers specify the minimum, default, and maximum values for each
axis they support, and allow the user fine grained control over the rendered text.

#### `font.variationAxes`

Returns an object describing the available variation axes. Keys are 4 letter axis tags, and values include `name`,
`min`, `default`, and `max` properties for the axis.

#### `font.namedVariations`

The font designer may have picked out some variations that they think look particularly good, for example a light, regular,
and bold weight which would traditionally be separate fonts. This property returns an object describing these named variation
instances that the designer has specified. Keys are variation names, and values are objects with axis settings.

#### `font.getVariation(variation)`

Returns a new font object representing this variation, from which you can get glyphs and perform layout as normal.
The `variation` parameter can either be a variation settings object or a string variation name. Variation settings objects
have axis names as keys, and numbers as values (should be in the range specified by `font.variationAxes`).

### Other methods

#### `font.getGlyph(glyph_id, codePoints = [])`

Returns a glyph object for the given glyph id. You can pass the array of code points this glyph represents for your use later, and it will be stored in the glyph object.

#### `font.createSubset()`

Returns a Subset object for this font, described below.

## Font Collection objects

For font collection files that contain multiple fonts in a single file, such as TrueType Collection (.ttc) and Datafork TrueType (.dfont) files, a font collection object can be returned by Fontkit.

### `collection.getFont(postscriptName)`

Gets a font from the collection by its postscript name. Returns a Font object, described above.

### `collection.fonts`

This property is a lazily-loaded array of all of the fonts in the collection.

## Glyph objects

Glyph objects represent a glyph in the font. They have various properties for accessing metrics and the actual vector path the glyph represents, and methods for rendering the glyph to a graphics context.

You do not create glyph objects directly. They are created by various methods on the font object, described above. There are several subclasses of the base `Glyph` class internally that may be returned depending on the font format, but they all include the following API.

### Properties

* `id` - the glyph id in the font
* `name` - the glyph name in the font
* `codePoints` - an array of unicode code points that are represented by this glyph. There can be multiple code points in the case of ligatures and other glyphs that represent multiple visual characters.
* `path` - a vector Path object representing the glyph
* `bbox` - the glyph’s bounding box, i.e. the rectangle that encloses the glyph outline as tightly as possible.
* `cbox` - the glyph’s control box. This is often the same as the bounding box, but is faster to compute. Because of the way bezier curves are defined, some of the control points can be outside of the bounding box. Where `bbox` takes this into account, `cbox` does not. Thus, `cbox` is less accurate, but faster to compute. See [here](http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-6.html#section-2) for a more detailed description.
* `advanceWidth` - the glyph’s advance width.

### `glyph.render(ctx, size)`

Renders the glyph to the given graphics context, at the specified font size.

### Color glyphs (e.g. emoji)

Fontkit has support for several different color emoji font formats. Currently, these include Apple’s SBIX table (as used by the “Apple Color Emoji” font), and Microsoft’s COLR table (supported by Windows 8.1). [Here](http://blog.symbolset.com/multicolor-fonts) is an overview of the various color font formats out there.

#### `glyph.getImageForSize(size)`

For SBIX glyphs, which are bitmap based, this returns an object containing some properties about the image, along with the image data itself (usually PNG).

#### `glyph.layers`

For COLR glyphs, which are vector based, this returns an array of objects representing the glyphs and colors for each layer in render order.

## Path objects

Path objects are returned by glyphs and represent the actual vector outlines for each glyph in the font. Paths can be converted to SVG path data strings, or to functions that can be applied to render the path to a graphics context.

### `path.moveTo(x, y)`

Moves the virtual pen to the given x, y coordinates.

### `path.lineTo(x, y)`

Adds a line to the path from the current point to the given x, y coordinates.

### `path.quadraticCurveTo(cpx, cpy, x, y)`

Adds a quadratic curve to the path from the current point to the given x, y coordinates using cpx, cpy as a control point.

### `path.bezierCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, x, y)`

Adds a bezier curve to the path from the current point to the given x, y coordinates using cp1x, cp1y and cp2x, cp2y as control points.

### `path.closePath()`

Closes the current sub-path by drawing a straight line back to the starting point.

### `path.toFunction()`

Compiles the path to a JavaScript function that can be applied with a graphics context in order to render the path.

### `path.toSVG()`

Converts the path to an SVG path data string.

### `path.bbox`

This property represents the path’s bounding box, i.e. the smallest rectangle that contains the entire path shape. This is the exact bounding box, taking into account control points that may be outside the visible shape.

### `path.cbox`

This property represents the path’s control box. It is like the bounding box, but it includes all points of the path, including control points of bezier segments. It is much faster to compute than the real bounding box, but less accurate if there are control points outside of the visible shape.

## Subsets

Fontkit can perform font subsetting, i.e. the process of creating a new font from an existing font where only the specified glyphs are included. This is useful to reduce the size of large fonts, such as in PDF generation or for web use.

Currently, subsets produce minimal fonts designed for PDF embedding that may not work as standalone files. They have no cmap tables and other essential tables for standalone use. This limitation will be removed in the future.

You create a Subset object by calling `font.createSubset()`, described above. The API on Subset objects is as follows.

### `subset.includeGlyph(glyph)`

Includes the given glyph object or glyph ID in the subset.

### `subset.encode()`

Returns a `Uint8Array` containing the encoded font file.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - hsl-to-hex@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# hsl-to-hex

Convert HSL colors to RGB colors in hex format.

## API

```
require('hsl-to-hex') => Function
hsl(hue, saturation, luminosity)` => String
```

## Example

```js
var hsl = require('hsl-to-hex')
var hue = 133 hsl(133, 40, 60)
var saturation = 40
var luminosity = 60
var hex = hsl(hue, saturation, luminosity)
console.log(hex) // #70c282

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - hsl-to-rgb-for-reals@1.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# hsl-to-rgb-for-reals

##HSL -> RGB
Convert HSL values (hue, saturation, light) to RGB values (red, green, blue). 
Expected values:
Hue: [0, 360[
Saturation: [0, 1]
Lightness: [0, 1]

## For Reals?
Author forgot to export their function in the hsl-to-rgb module,
there's a PR that's been sitting for over a year (at time of writing).
Let's use `hsl-to-rgb-for-reals` until original author merges. Huzzah!

Funny story - I forgot to module export in v1.0.0 too! Don't use 1.0.0.

Getting started:

```sh
npm install hsl-to-rgb-for-reals --save
```

Use:

```js
var converter = require('hsl-to-rgb-for-reals');

var slateBlue = converter(223, 0.44, 0.56);

console.log(slateBlue);
// logs [93, 121, 192]
```


## Problems

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - yoga-layout@2.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# yoga-layout

This package provides prebuilt JavaScript bindings for the Yoga layout engine. Both WebAssembly and asm.js variants are packaged, with the optimal loaded based on platform.

## Usage

The default entrypoint provides an asynchronous loader function to return a Yoga instance.

```ts
import {loadYoga, Align} from 'yoga-layout';

const Yoga = await loadYoga();

const node = Yoga.Node.create();
node.setAlignContent(Align.Center);
```

An alternative synchronous API is provided for compatibility, but requires using asm.js in browsers instead of WebAssembly, leading to worse performance and larger assets.

```ts
import Yoga, {Align} from 'yoga-layout/sync';

const node = Yoga.Node.create();
node.setAlignContent(Align.Center);
```

Objects created by `Yoga.<>.create()` are not automatically garbage collected and should be freed once they are no longer in use.

```ts
// Free a config
config.free();

// Free a tree of Nodes
node.freeRecursive();

// Free a single Node
node.free();
```

## Selecting WebAssembly or asm.js

For better performance and smaller packages, WebAssembly is preferred to asm.js where available. `yoga-layout` tries to provide the right default using [export maps](https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/#conditional-syntax) so that platforms which can take advantage of WebAssembly use it by default.

Different entrypoints are exposed to choose a flavor explicitly.

```ts
import {loadYoga} from 'yoga-layout/wasm-async';
```

## Using TypeScript

This package provides out-of-the-box TypeScript typings so long as `tsc` is configured to support ESM resolution. It is recommended to set `moduleResolution: 'bundler'` or `moduleResolution: node16` in your `tsconfig.json` according to your environment.

## Contributing

### Requirements

1. Emscripten SDK
1. CMake >= 3.13
1. (Optional) ninja, for faster builds

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/yoga.git
cd yoga/javascript
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Build and test all entrypoints
yarn test

# Build and test a specific entrypoint
yarn test:asmjs-sync
```
