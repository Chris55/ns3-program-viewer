                                        Good news: we removed all cookie banners from <AppName />! ðŸŽ‰
                                    </Card.Text>
                                    <Card.Text>
                                        No one likes cookie banners. But cookie banners are everywhere. So how did we
                                        pull this off?
                                    </Card.Text>
                                    <Card.Text>
                                        Well, EU law requires you to use cookie banners if your website contains cookies
                                        that are not required for it to work. Common examples of such cookies are those
                                        used by third-party analytics, tracking, and advertising services. These
                                        services collect information about peopleâ€™s behavior across the web, store it in
                                        their databases, and can use it to serve personalized ads.

                                    <Card.Text>
                                        At <AppName />, we want to protect user privacy, and we find cookie banners
                                        quite irritating, so we decided to look for a solution. After a brief search, we
                                        found one: just donâ€™t use any non-essential cookies. Pretty simple, really. ðŸ¤”

                                    <Card.Text>
                                        So, we have removed all non-essential cookies from <AppName /> , and visiting
                                        our website does not send any information to third-party analytics services.
                                        (And of course <AppName /> still does not use any cookies to display ads, or
                                        track you across other sites.)
